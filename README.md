## Challenges

My biggest challenge was to get the user authorization implemented. I continued getting errors so in the interest of getting this project completed on time, it had to be dropped.

My other big challenge was gettint the carousel implemented. I tried several methods, but struggled to get it to look the way I liked. In the end, I used a tutorial from Medium.com (https://medium.com/tinyso/how-to-create-the-responsive-and-swipeable-carousel-slider-component-in-react-99f433364aa0).
